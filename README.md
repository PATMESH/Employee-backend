# EmployWise Spring Boot Employee Management System

## Project Overview
This project implements an Employee Management System using Spring Boot. It provides RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations on employees and includes features such as retrieving the nth level manager of an employee, pagination, sorting, sending email notifications to the level 1 manager on new employee addition, and hosting the application on a free platform.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have Java JDK and Maven installed.
2. No need to make the edit in the code and properties file.
3. I have used the MongoDB Atlas as NoSQL database and configure the connection details in `application.yml`.
4. Configure SMTP server details in `application.properties` for sending email notifications.
5. Run the application
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.
